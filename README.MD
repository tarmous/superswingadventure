unity version: 2019.1.8f1

Using the same Module based procedurally generated map philosophy as in Lootrun, Super Swing Adventure is an endless runner mobile game, developed in Unity in 2019, where the player controls a ball that throws a hook which allows it to swing through the level as fast as possible. I was the sole programmer of the team.
